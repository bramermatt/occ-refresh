    <h1>About One Community Church</h1>
    <p>One Community Church started as a mission in October of 2005 as Harvest Valley Community Church (HVCC). Our purpose was to reach not only the youth of Southern Indiana but their parents as well. As we began to grow we moved to GRC Elementary school.</p>
    <p>The following summer we moved to neighboring Clarksville Elementary school. In March of 2011, we began a new era at HVCC. We added two additional pastors to our staff to focus on the needs of the adults and young adults. In the fall of 2013 we began sharing space with Charity Community Church.</p>
    <p>We officially merged in the Spring of 2014 with Charity Community Church to form One Community Church at 1810 Blackiston Mill Rd. in Clarksville. God has truly blessed us in so many ways and we are very excited for the future.</p>

    <h2>Andy Bramer</h2>
    <h3>Student & Family Pastor</h3>
    <img src="img/pastors/andy.png">
    <p>My name is Andy Bramer I am the Student and Family Pastor of One Community Church. I have been working with students and their families for over  20 years.  My wife (Ann Marie) and I, have been blessed with 2 awesome sons, Jon and Matt, who are now both married. Jon and his wife, Emily have blessed us with 3 beautiful grandkids (Annabelle, JR and Oliver. Matt and his wife Sandy just blessed us with our 4th grandchild, Everett. They are also a part of our worship team at OCC. I came to know Christ when I was 12 years old while attending a local church. I struggled in my walk with Christ while I was in middle and high school. By the time I was realized it was time to quite running. I responded to God’s call into full time youth ministry at the age of 25 and have never looked back. I love working with and ministering to students and their families. One of the ways I am able to do that is through Campus Life & the Fellowship of Christian Athletes that meet weekly at Clarksville Middle & High School. I love the local church and would be glad to talk with you about any questions you might have. Don’t hesitate to call or text me at 502-693-7090 or email me at andy@ onecommunity.church.</p>

    <h2>Brion Rector</h2>
    <h3>Adult Pastor</h3>
    <img src="img/pastors/brion.png">
    <p>My name is Brion Rector. I am also one of the associate pastors. One of my roles includes  leading our adults.  My wife Hope and I have been married since the summer of 2009.  On May the 16th 2014 we welcomed our daughter Grace Anne Rector into the world. After much prayer, thought and discussion I felt God was calling my wife and I not only to this church but also to this position. The Lord came into my life in 1998 and life has been a roller coaster ride, full of highs, lows and a few surprise turns ever since. Since God has become the center of my life, I have seen His plan and purpose for my life. I will continue to focus on what God wants in my life and marriage and let God lead me where He needs me to go.  We love it here at One Community Church. I have been involved in various aspects of ministry over the last 12 years in churches primarily located in Southern Indiana. Youth ministry was my primary calling but have recently felt God calling me into the role of adult pastor. I look forward to meeting you and hearing what God is doing in your life. Please don’t hesitate to call or email me if you have any questions. 812-406-8021 or brionrector@onecommunity.church or on twitter @brionrector</p>

    <h2>Daniel Tatum</h2>
    <h3>Young Adult Pastor</h3>
    <img src="img/pastors/daniel.jpg">
    <p>My name is Daniel Tatum. I am one the associate pastors, besides alternating preaching on Sundays I also lead one of the adult life groups.  I have been married to my lovely wife Wendi since 2004. We have been blessed with two children, Saul and Josie. My walk with God started with the seed my mother planted while dragging me to church and Sunday school every week when I was a kid. I gave my life to Christ when I was 13, but I really started building a stronger relationship with him when I met Wendi. We started attending church together and in 2006 our path led us to Harvest Valley (now One Community). We quickly felt like we had found a church family instead of just a church. God has steadily led us to take on more responsibility in the church. Wendi is active in her role in working with the students while I also lead the tech team.  My passion is teaching and I hope to make learning to walk with God a simple and easy to understand concept. God has called me to outreach and I also feel very strong about helping the young men in our church develop into good Christian men as they grow older. We would be glad to see you and your family join us in worshiping and serving God. You can reach me at 606-224-0014 or email me at daniel@ onecommunity.church.</p>

    <h2>What Type of Music?</h2>
    <p>We believe that God loves music and so do we! We have been beyond blessed to have several God gifted musicians and singers lead us on a weekly basis! We combine a mix of contemporary worship songs while trying not to forget some of the classic hymns.</p>
    <h3>Oh come, let us sing to the Lord; let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation! Psalm 95:1 (ESV)</h3>

    <h2>Have Kids?</h2>
    <p>We love children, please bring them! We have a nursery and a great children's program available during every service! They will be well taken care of, and learn something in the process.</p>

Bring them to class allows us to help your child become closer to Jesus. During class we retell Bible stories, do activities, crafts, songs, games and so much more to help your child understand and become closer to Jesus. Come let your child join in the fun. We cannot wait to see you there.</p>
