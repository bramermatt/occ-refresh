    <h1>One Community Church</h1>
    <p>One Community Church started as a mission in October of 2005 as Harvest Valley Community Church (HVCC). Our purpose was to reach not only the youth of Southern Indiana but their parents as well. As we began to grow we moved to GRC Elementary school.</p>
    <p>The following summer we moved to neighboring Clarksville Elementary school. In March of 2011, we began a new era at HVCC. We added two additional pastors to our staff to focus on the needs of the adults and young adults. In the fall of 2013 we began sharing space with Charity Community Church.</p>
    <p>We officially merged in the Spring of 2014 with Charity Community Church to form One Community Church at 1810 Blackiston Mill Rd. in Clarksville. God has truly blessed us in so many ways and we are very excited for the future.</p>

    <h1>What to Expect</h1>
    <h2>What to Expect on Your First Visit?</h2>
    <p>After arriving and finding the perfect parking spot, enter at one of our two main entrances! Feel free to enjoy some of the snacks or drinks that are always available before every service.</p>

    <h2>What To Wear?</h2>
    <p>Our dress is casual and comfortable. Jeans, khakis, or even shorts are fine! It is a matter of the heart that we are concerned with.</p>
    <h3>But the Lord said to Samuel, “Do not look on his appearance or on the height of his stature because I have rejected him. For the Lord sees not as man sees: man looks on the outward appearance, but the Lord looks on the heart.” 1 Samuel 16:7 (ESV)</h3>

    <h2>What Type of Music?</h2>
    <p>We believe that God loves music and so do we! We have been beyond blessed to have several God gifted musicians and singers lead us on a weekly basis! We combine a mix of contemporary worship songs while trying not to forget some of the classic hymns.</p>
    <h3>Oh come, let us sing to the Lord; let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation! Psalm 95:1 (ESV)</h3>

    <h2>Have Kids?</h2>
    <p>We love children, please bring them! We have a nursery and a great children's program available during every service! They will be well taken care of, and learn something in the process.</p>
    <h3>Train up a child in the way he should go: even when he is old he will not depart from it. Proverbs 22:6 (ESV)</h3>
